# Customer-Segmentation-and-Purchase-Prediction-ML
In the competitive world of marketing and e-commerce, businesses must understand their customers deeply to improve engagement and increase revenue.
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and segmenting customers into meaningful groups based on demographic and spending patterns.

Further, we use supervised machine learning to predict whether a customer is a potential high spender or not, enabling targeted marketing and efficient resource allocation.
